# BlackjackRL: Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning with Card Counting

This project implements a reinforcement learning–based Blackjack agent trained using **Monte Carlo on-policy and off-policy methods**.  
The agent combines **Blackjack Basic Strategy** with a **Complete Point-Count (card counting) system** inspired by Edward O. Thorp’s *Beat the Dealer*.

The goal of the project is to study how reinforcement learning can improve decision-making in stochastic environments by leveraging domain knowledge such as card counting.
